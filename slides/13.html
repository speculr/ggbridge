<h2>What to do instead?</h2>

<p>investing in people instead of physical barriers</p>

<aside class="notes">
  I don’t have any particular opinions about where the money should
go instead. My main argument is concerned mostly with how we shouldn’t spend it on a suicide net. What I can honestly urge for is further support in social welfare programs and improving the network of places for help. Programs like alcholics anonymous have proven to be very effective but it is not necessarily a part of mainstream culture. People all-too-often fall through the cracks.
